## Analysing Data Science Books from Amazon Kindle
As a student studying Data Science, I am always hunting for helpful literature in the domain. With the crazy amount of books in the market, it can get quite overwhelming and confusing when choosing a book. It is also very time-consuming to go through all the reviews and finding something that fits my needs.

With this motivation, the scope of my project is to use 2 levels of analysis on a datast of almost 1000 books on data science. I will not be looking into other niches (that might have a different characteristics and audience base).
